# firstJavaScriptCode

"Should I even put this on GitHub?" - The question I ask myself when starting to learn a new language and I write goofy, simple stuff like this "guided project" for a learning platform like JetBrains academy. At this point, I've learned Python, Go, SQL, and used Lisp/Scheme extensively on my own learning time. I have actual professional experience, and I'm not looking for my first job anymore.

But my approach to learning hasn't changed - I happen to not have done anything with JavaScript yet, and I want to familiarize myself with it. The process of familiarization isn't pretty, and doesn't result in the kind of technical wonders that people are proud of. I don't want to keep that hidden, and I want to always be able to look and remind myself what it takes to learn a new thing. I've been told that having this kind of stuff public is a huge turn off for recruiters and such, because it makes me look amateurish, like I don't know what I'm doing.

Well, when it comes to JavaScript specifically right now, I don't know what I'm doing. I have solid knowledge in many CS and programming areas, but JS isn't one of them, not yet. And this is where I started with it. And this is the level I'll start with when learning anything new, because I'm still convinced that starting from the ground level is the best way to truly get to understand something.
